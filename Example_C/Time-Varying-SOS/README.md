**Example C**- Risk Bounded Trajectory Planning for Delivery Robots-Figure 10

Julia code:

1) Add required functions: include("func_PathPlanningSOS.jl")
2) Main code to obtain the risk bounded trajectory: include("main.jl")

Plots:
1) Risk contours of the vehicles: main_1_RiskContours_obs1.m, main_2_RiskContours_obs2.m, and main_2_RiskContours_obs3.m
2) Obtained trajectory: main_plot_traj.m
