**Illustrative Example B**-Figure 9

Julia code:

Install the required packages listed in func_PathPlanningSOS.jl.


1) Add required functions: include("func_PathPlanningSOS.jl")
2) Main code to obtain the risk bounded trajectory: include("main.jl")

Plots:
1) Risk contours of the vehicles: main_1_RiskContours_vehicle1.m and main_2_RiskContours_vehicle2.m
2) Obtained trajectory: main_plot_traj.m
