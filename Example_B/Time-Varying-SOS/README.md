**Illustrative Example B**-Figure 9

Julia code:

1) Add required functions: include("func_PathPlanningSOS.jl")
2) Risk contours of the vehicles: main_1_RiskContours_vehicle1.m and main_2_RiskContours_vehicle2.m
3) Main code to obtain the risk bounded trajectory: include("main.jl")





** This code uses time-varying-sos optimization tools developed by:
